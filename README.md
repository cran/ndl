# The NDL (Naive Discriminative Learning) package

The NDL package implements the Danks Equilibra ([read the paper here][1]) for
the Rescorla Wagner model of learning ([read about the RW model here][2]).

See NEWS for a list of recent changes to the package.

The original paper that describes this model (and which you should use as a citation when reporting ndl models):

Baayen, R. H., Milin, P., Filipovic Durdevic, D., Hendrix, P. and Marelli, M. (2011), An amorphous model for morphological processing in visual comprehension based on naive discriminative learning. Psychological Review 118, 438-482.

can be downloaded from [here][3]

## See the R documentation for more info and examples. We hope to add a very extensive vignette to the package in the near future.
