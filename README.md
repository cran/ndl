# The NDL (Naive Discriminative Learning) package
 
The NDL package implements the Danks Equilibra ([read the paper here][1]) for the Rescorla Wagner model of learning ([read about the RW model here][2]).
 
A paper about this model (which you should use as a citation):

Baayen, R. H., Milin, P., Filipovic Durdevic, D., Hendrix, P. and Marelli, M. (2011), An amorphous model for morphological processing in visual comprehension based on naive discriminative learning. Psychological Review 118, 438-482.
